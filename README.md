The repository to make up kayrabahadir.com

The world is too crowded, almost 8 billion people, do you think all of us are unique? Nope. As I grew, I have realized that there will be tonnes of people coming into my life, but the sweet and bitter job you have as a live-r is to figure out who to keep in your life. 

Someone needs to be unique, different, interestingly-approaching and always be putting a new approach or thought to the table if they deserve a spot in your tableâ€”at least this is how it works in my table. 

With this website, I aspire to move ahead of sheeps that are releasing dopamine from getting 10 or landing a job, and actually open up my mind to everyone. You get to explore my thoughts, every crevice of my juicy brain and my feelings, and I am doing this in a nice fashion by praciticing my web-developer and designer skills. Be unique.  

The website is created using `three.js` library with vanilla CSS and HTML. TO_BE_COMPLETED*
